/** <module> The incremental update algorithm for an ATMS.

The label of node =N= consists of the environments whose assumptions are
the union of the assumptions of environments from the labels of nodes
from every justification of =N=.

Suppose node =N= has justifications =J_k=.
These justifications have antecedent nodes =N_{i,k}= (for the i-th
assumption node in the k-th justification on =N=).
Then =label(N) = \Union { {e_1, \ldots, e_k } \vert e_j \in L_{i,j} }=

From this union the nogood and subsumed environments are removed.
A nogood is an environment that has been marked as such. The ATMS keeps a
list of nogoods.
A subsumed environment in =label(N)= is an environment whose assumptions
are a strict superset of the assumptions in any of the other members of
=label(N)=.
